# MCP6S22 eagle library
The Microchip Technology Inc. MCP6S21/2/6/8 are analog Programmable Gain Amplifiers (PGA). 
They can be configured for gains from +1 V/V to +32 V/V and the input multiplexer can select one of up to eight channels through an 
SPI port. The serial interface can also put the PGA into shutdown to conserve power. These PGAs are optimized for high speed, 
low offset voltage and single-supply operation with rail-to-rail input and output capability. 
These specifications support single supply applications needing flexible performance or multiple input
